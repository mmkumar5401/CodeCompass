# CodeCompass

A local code knowledge graph that gives AI agents (and humans) a map of your codebase — so they know what's connected before they edit.

---

## The problem

AI coding agents read files one at a time. They don't know that renaming a function in `auth.py` will break three importers, a test file, and a CSS class that shares the name. They guess which files to open, miss dependencies, and introduce bugs.

## The solution

CodeCompass parses your codebase into a dependency graph — functions, classes, modules, imports, CSS selectors, HTML references — and stores it as a local JSON file. Agents query the graph before editing to see exactly what's connected.

No database. No cloud. One JSON file per repo.

---

## What you get

Every node in the graph carries:
- **`kind`** — type and language combined (e.g. `function:python`, `class:typescript`, `css_selector:scss`)
- **`description`** — human-readable label (e.g. `python function in src/auth/login.py`)
- **Typed edges** — `CALLS`, `IMPORTS`, `INHERITS`, `DEFINED_IN`, `STYLES`, `USES_VAR`, `REFERENCES`, etc.

Agents can answer structural questions in milliseconds without reading a single file:

```bash
# What breaks if I edit this?
codecompass query --blast-radius src/auth/login.py

# Who calls this function?
codecompass query --impact "authenticate"

# What does this file depend on?
codecompass query --deps src/api/routes.py

# Full project structure with entity types
codecompass query --tree
```

All commands default to the current directory.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip

### Install

```bash
# From the codecompass directory
pip install -e .
```

### Index a project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
codecompass init
codecompass ingest-code
```

That's it. Two commands:
1. **`init`** creates `.codecompass/` and writes agent instructions into `AGENTS.md`
2. **`ingest-code`** parses all source files and builds the graph

`ingest-code` runs `init` automatically if `.codecompass/` doesn't exist yet.

### What happens on init

- Creates `.codecompass/` with `graph.json`, `overview.md`, `memory.md`, and `learnings.md`
- Writes a `## Code graph` section into the project's `AGENTS.md` with mandatory rules for agents:
  - Run `--blast-radius` before editing any file
  - Run `--impact` before calling unfamiliar symbols
  - Re-ingest after creating or deleting files

Any AI agent that reads `AGENTS.md` (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, etc.) will follow these rules automatically.

## Queries

| Command | When to use it |
|---|---|
| `codecompass query --blast-radius <file_or_symbol>` | Before editing — see everything that depends on it |
| `codecompass query --impact <symbol>` | Before renaming/removing — find all callers and importers |
| `codecompass query --deps <file>` | Understanding a file — see what it imports and uses |
| `codecompass query --trace <function>` | Follow a call chain forward |
| `codecompass query --tree` | Orient yourself — full project structure |
| `codecompass query --styles <element>` | Find CSS selectors for an HTML element |
| `codecompass query --batch-impact <f1> <f2> ...` | Multi-file PR — union blast radius |
| `codecompass query --flow <entry_symbol>` | Trace the call/import flow from an entry point |
| `codecompass query --dead-code` | Find functions/classes with no caller or importer |

Add `--rich` for formatted table output. Add `--hops N` to control traversal depth (default: 3).

### Dead code

`--dead-code` reports entities with no inbound `CALLS`/`IMPORTS`/`REFERENCES` edge — candidates for removal such as old helpers, superseded function versions, or orphaned scripts:

```bash
codecompass query --dead-code                      # likely-dead only
codecompass query --dead-code --include-entrypoints  # also show probable entry points
```

Results are split into **likely dead** (private/internal, no caller) and **possible entry points** (`run_*`, handlers, tests — invoked by a runtime, not a static call). This is **static analysis**: dynamic dispatch, reflection, and string-based invocation are invisible, so every result is a candidate to verify (grep the name across the repo) before deleting.

### Flow charts

`--flow` traces forward from an entry point along `CALLS` and `IMPORTS` edges. Pick an output format with `--format`:

```bash
codecompass query --flow "src.main" --hops 3                    # draw.io (default)
codecompass query --flow "src.main" --format mermaid           # Markdown + mermaid
codecompass query --flow "src.main" --format json              # agent narration
```

Every format numbers each call by source line so call order is explicit. By default, external/stdlib symbols are filtered out — add `--include-external` to show everything. Output is written to `.codecompass/flow_<entry>.{drawio,md,json}`.

- **`drawio`** — opens in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) (desktop or web). Nodes color-coded by type, entry point has a thick border, edges color-coded by relationship (blue = CALLS, green = IMPORTS).
- **`mermaid`** — a Markdown file with an embedded mermaid flowchart that renders directly on GitHub. Convert to SVG with `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i flow_<entry>.md -o flow_<entry>.svg`.
- **`json`** — each node carries its real signature, docstring, source snippet, and line range; each edge carries its call order and call site. Built for agents: feed it to an LLM to generate a comprehensive data-flow explanation of how a pipeline or feature actually works.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `codecompass init [path]` | Create `.codecompass/` and register in `AGENTS.md` |
| `codecompass ingest-code [path]` | Parse source files and build/rebuild the graph |
| `codecompass query <flags> [path]` | Query the graph (blast-radius, impact, deps, flow, tree, etc.) |
| `codecompass watch [path]` | Live re-index on file changes |
| `codecompass load-triples <file> <path>` | Load pre-processed triples from JSON |
| `codecompass setup` | Copy instructions to `~/.config/opencode/codecompass/` |

All commands default to `.` (current directory) when path is omitted.

## How it works

```
Source files
    │
    ▼
hierarchy_builder    — walks repo → Project / Folder / File skeleton
    │
    ▼
code_parser          — tree-sitter extraction (no API calls)
    │                  extracts entities + relationships as CodeTriples
    ▼
graph.json           — NetworkX MultiDiGraph serialized as JSON node-link data
    │                  typed edges: CALLS, IMPORTS, INHERITS, STYLES, DEFINED_IN, …
    │                  node attrs: kind, description, language, entity_type, file
    ▼
code_query_cli       — graph traversal: blast-radius, impact, deps, trace, tree
    │
    ▼
AGENTS.md            — mandatory rules injected into the project for any AI agent
```

Everything runs locally, in-process. No network calls, no database, no API keys.

## Tips

- **Commit or gitignore** `.codecompass/graph.json` — your choice. Committing it means teammates and CI get the graph for free.
- **Re-ingest after refactors** — moved functions, renamed classes, deleted files. The graph doesn't auto-update unless `watch` is running.
- **Use `watch` during active development** — `codecompass watch` keeps the graph current as you save files.
- **Install once, use everywhere** — `pip install -e .` from the codecompass directory. The `codecompass` command works in any project.

---

## Limitations

- **Structure only** — the graph knows what calls what, not what anything *means*
- **No cross-repo edges** — entities outside the indexed repo won't appear
- **Lit CSS** covers explicit `var(--foo)` and `:host` declarations; generated property names from `theme.props()` are not indexed
- **Large repos** (50k+ files) may produce sizable graph files — benchmark before committing
